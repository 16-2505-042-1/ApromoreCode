Apromore Build Instructions with Eclipse Virgo


REQUIREMENTS
============

Apromore has been successfully installed on the following platforms:
- Windows 7
- Linux (specifically ubuntu)
- Mac OSX 10.8 to 10.10

Ensure the following software is installed:
- Java 1.7
- Maven 3.1.1
- Ant 1.9.2
- MySQL 5.6.x
- Git 2.3.5
- LoLA 2.0 (http://service-technology.org/lola/)

MySQL is the default db that we support.  We do have plugins for Postgres and Oracle, but some extra setup will be required. The manager
application will need to be told about the change as well as the Assembly project. Also we only have sql scripts to create the database
for H2 and MySQL.

Check out the Apromore source tree from the github repository at https://github.com/apromore/ApromoreCode.git


CONFIGURATION
=============

Configuration occurs in the top level site.properties file.  The default version of this file from a fresh git checkout contains
reasonable defaults that use MySQL as the main database, but disable PQL (which requires Postgres and more intricate configuration).
At this point MySQL isn't required for the builds at it now uses H2. To run Apromore after the build you will need MySQL setup.
Ensure MySQL is configured to accept local TCP connections on port 3306 in its .cnf file; "skip-networking" should not be present.


DATABASE SETUP
==============

Start MySQL
$ sudo mysqld_safe

Set the root password of MySQL to the default used by Apromore
$ mysqladmin -u root password MAcri

Create databases named 'apromore' and 'pql' in your MySQL server
$ mysqladmin --user=root --password=MAcri create apromore
$ mysqladmin --user=root --password=MAcri create pql

Create a user named 'apromore' with the required permissions
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri
	CREATE USER 'apromore'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MAcri';
	GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK TABLES ON apromore.* TO 'apromore'@'localhost';
	GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK TABLES ON pql.* TO 'apromore'@'localhost';

Create and populate the database tables.
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri < Supplements/database/db-mysql.sql
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri < Supplements/database/pql.sql

At the end of the db-mysql.sql script is where we populate some of the system data including user information. Currently, we have a few users setup that are developers or affiliates and they can be used or you can choose to add your own.  All passwords are encrypted but they are 'password' for the time being and we don't have a facility just yet to allow a user to change their password. This is coming soon as well as a setup utility to allow the creation of a user on first running.


BUILD IT
========

* Change to the root of the project you checked out of SVN.
* Run the maven command 'mvn clean install'. This will build the Apromore manager, portal and editor and all the extra plugins.
* Run the ant command 'ant start-virgo'. This will install, configure and start Eclipse Virgo, and deploy Apromore.


TRY IT OUT
==========

Apromore runs on all modern browsers, browse http://localhost:9000/portal
