Apromore Build Instructions with Eclipse Virgo


REQUIREMENTS
============

Apromore has been successfully installed on the following platforms:
- Windows 7
- Linux (specifically ubuntu)
- Mac OSX 10.8 to 10.11

Ensure the following software is installed:
- Java 1.7
- Maven 3.1.1
- Ant 1.9.2
- Git 2.3.5

Additional software required for PQL support:
- MySQL 5.6.x
- LoLA 2.0 (http://service-technology.org/lola/)


DEFAULT INSTALLATION
====================

* Check out the Apromore source tree using git: 'git clone https://github.com/apromore/ApromoreCode.git'
* Change to the root of the project you checked out of git.  'cd ApromoreCore'
* Run the maven command 'mvn clean install'. This will build the Apromore manager, portal and editor and all the extra plugins.
* Create an empty H2 database 'ant create-h2'.  Only do this once, unless you just want to reset to a blank database later on.
* Run the ant command 'ant start-virgo'. This will install, configure and start Eclipse Virgo, and deploy Apromore.
* Apromore runs on all modern browsers, browse http://localhost:9000/portal
* Ctrl-C on the command line will shut the server down.


CONFIGURATION
=============

Configuration occurs in the top level site.properties file.  The default version of this file from a fresh git checkout contains
reasonable defaults that use H2 as the main database, but disable PQL (which requires MySQL or Postgres and more intricate
configuration).

H2 running from a flat file is the default database for the sake of zero-configuration.
However our development is done chiefly on MySQL; instructions for reconfiguring Apromore to use MySQL appear below.
We do have plugins for Postgres and Oracle, but some extra setup will be required since we only have sql scripts to create the
database for H2 and MySQL.


DATABASE SETUP (MySQL)
======================

Ensure MySQL is configured to accept local TCP connections on port 3306 in its .cnf file; "skip-networking" should not be present.

Start MySQL
$ sudo mysqld_safe

Set the root password of MySQL to the default used by Apromore
$ mysqladmin -u root password MAcri

Create databases named 'apromore' and 'pql' in your MySQL server
$ mysqladmin --user=root --password=MAcri create apromore
$ mysqladmin --user=root --password=MAcri create pql

Create a user named 'apromore' with the required permissions
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri
	CREATE USER 'apromore'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MAcri';
	GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK TABLES ON apromore.* TO 'apromore'@'localhost';
	GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK TABLES ON pql.* TO 'apromore'@'localhost';

Create and populate the database tables.
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri < Supplements/database/db-mysql.sql
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri < Supplements/database/pql.sql

At the end of the db-mysql.sql script is where we populate some of the system data including user information. Currently, we have a few users setup that are developers or affiliates and they can be used or you can choose to add your own.  All passwords are encrypted but they are 'password' for the time being and we don't have a facility just yet to allow a user to change their password. This is coming soon as well as a setup utility to allow the creation of a user on first running.

Edit the top-level site.properties file, replacing the H2 declarations in "Database and JPA" with the commented-out MySQL properties.
Stop and restart the server so that it picks up the changes to site.properties.
